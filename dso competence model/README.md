# Data Science Competence Model

The vision of DSO is that a data scientists should be able to handle whole stack of DS project activities: talk to customers, understand their needs and define the solution, create, build and test DS models and deliver them in a form that can be used, deployed and maintained (by engineers, DevOps etc) without involvement of the data scientist.
To implement this vision, a competence model includes three areas: Business, Logic and Technology. These areas contain skills required for business understanding, using applied math for solving them and implementing the solution correspondingly.
